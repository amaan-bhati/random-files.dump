        <p>Hey! <span class="highlight">Welcome to The Keploy API Fellowship Program.</span></p>

        <p>We received an overwhelming response from over <strong>18.5k applicants</strong> worldwide, and after careful
            consideration, we've selected just <strong>1,000 fellows</strong> for this cohort. You're among the talented
            individuals we believe in - those with exceptional potential to learn, grow, and make an impact in the tech
            world.</p>

            <h3>TL;DR:</h3>
            <p>Congratulations on making it to the Keploy API Fellowship!</p>
            <p>You've officially been selected to join an exclusive community of API builders, devs, and creators who
                are as passionate as you. Based on your background and your drive to learn and grow, you're now part of
                a space built for people who want to go from curious to crazy-skilled - building apps from scratch,
                contributing to open source, learn about APIs, integrate them with applications, test them
                professionally with best practices and launch them, all while having fun and creating things that are
                genuinely dope.</p>
            <p>As a GSoC(Google Summer Of Code) community, we believe in giving back to open source and community - for
                free. This is your safe space, your home, your playground. You'll have the freedom to learn fast, break
                things (safely), build things (as if it's a piece of art) and launch even faster - without owing us
                anything but good energy and a passion to grow. You're here because you belong here.</p>

              Welcome to the fellowship. This isn't just about learning APIs or tests - it's about unlearning the boring way it's always been done. You're not just here to follow docs. You're here to rewrite them. Let's have some fun.
              <br><br>
              This is not a bootcamp. It's a builder's lab. Don't just follow instructions. Question them. Break APIs. Question the output. Understand the "why" behind every test. You're here because you think like a developer - not a checkbox checker.
