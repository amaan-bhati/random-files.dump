        <p>You made it through the shortlisting phase. You are amongst those in whom we found a thing for learning and making it big. We'll get started soon, till then feel free to ask your doubts on our <a href="https://join.slack.com/t/keploy/shared_invite/zt-357qqm9b5-PbZRVu3Yt2rJIa6ofrwWNg"> Slack channel.</a></p>

            <h3>TL;DR:</h3>
            <p>Congratulations on making it to the Keploy API Fellowship!</p>
            <p>You've officially been selected to join an exclusive community of API builders, devs, and creators who are as passionate as you. Based on your background and your drive to learn and grow, you're now part of a space built for people who want to go from curious to crazy-skilled - building apps from scratch, contributing to open source, learn about APIs, integrate them with applications, test them professionally with best practices and launch them, all while having fun and creating things that are genuinely dope.</p>
            <p>As a GSoC(Google Summer Of Code) community, we believe in giving back to open source and community - for free. This is your safe space, your home, your playground. You'll have the freedom to learn fast, break things (safely), build things (as if it's a piece of art) and launch even faster - without owing us anything but good energy and a passion to grow. You're here because you belong here.</p>
